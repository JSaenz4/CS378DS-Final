It is a nationwide census providing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Congress and the American Public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.\n\nhttp://www.nhtsa.gov/FARS\n\n##Findings\nOur searches were related to drug and alcohol use while causing fatal\ntraffic accidents.  We wondered whether people who were drinking and\ndriving (and speeding) occurred in different rates between different\nincome brackets.  We looked at the brackets 0-30K, 30K-60K, and 60K+.  \n\nWe found that there was a correlation between people who make more\nthan 60K and people who were speeding and causing fatal traffic\naccidents.  \n\nSince the income in our set is the median income from the zip code\nwhere the person is licensed, we thought therre could be more learned\nfrom examining speeding against other attributes.  We found that\npeople who drive cars that might be considered \"sporty\" were speeding\nat higher rates than those who drove a less \"sporty\" car.  \n\nAfter looking at just income, we decided to look at some other\nfactors, and we found that there were some makes of cars, such as\nPorsche, that show a much higher probability of having drug use, in\naddition to speeding, and alcohol use being involved in the accident.  \n\nContinuing the drug theme, we decided to look at which states had\nhigher rates of drug related accidents.  After filtering out those\nthat had too few records to be significant (some states only had 1),\nwe found that Arkansas, Illinois, and Texas had some of the highest\nrates of drug related traffic accidents.  Illinois and Texas are two\nof the most populous states, but Arkansas is the [32nd most populous\nstate.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population#States_and_territories)\n\nWe also decided to use anomaly detection to try to find out what makes\na typical drunk driver.  We found that the msot anomalous data points\nwere those in which the driver had no prior license suspensions, dwi,\nor speeding citations.   \n\n##Analysis\n\n###Tableau Analysis\n####Speeding while Drunk by Income\n![](./images/speeding_by_income.png)\n\n**Description of \"Speeding Income\"**\nAverage of Was Speeding for each Capped Median (bin).
